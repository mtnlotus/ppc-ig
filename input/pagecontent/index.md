### Introduction

[Patient Priorities Care (PPC)](https://patientprioritiescare.org) is an evidence-based approach for identifying patients’ health priorities and aligning decision-making and care to those priorities. The FHIR profiles and terminology in this implementation guide were developed to support all information captured in their patient-facing app [MyHealthPriorities.org](https://myhealthpriorities.org).

This FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) is derived from the [HL7 Person-Centered Outcomes (PCO) IG](https://build.fhir.org/ig/mtnlotus/pco-ig/index.html) specification.

#### Background

The [Age-Friendly Health Systems (AFHS)](https://www.ihi.org/networks/initiatives/age-friendly-health-systems) initiative follows evidence-based practices to align with What Matters (i.e., ‘values’) to the older adult and their family caregivers. 

* **What Matters**: Know and align care with each older adult's specific health outcome goals and care preferences including, but not limited to, end-of-life care, and across settings of care.

After capturing what matters, the clinician and patient work together to document person-centered outcome goals and collaborate on action steps to achieve them.
